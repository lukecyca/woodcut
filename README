Minimalist content management system for static websites

== Design ==
Woodcut is a system for building static websites from Genshi source files.  It will search your source directory for files ending in 'xhtml' and process them into corresponding `html` files.  Similarly, it will process `.foo.xml` files into `.foo` files, and `.foo.newtxt` files into `.foo` files.

== Examples ==
There is a simple source directory at `example/src`.

A live example is http://lukecyca.com.


== Installation ==
There is no easy way to install it yet.  Instead, source the working copy:

mbp:woodcut luke$ . env.sh 

== Usage ==

mbp:woodcut luke$ woodcut --make example/src
